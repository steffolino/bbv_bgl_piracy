```

### **Step 2: API Endpoints Enhancement**
```typescript
// New API endpoints needed:
GET /api/players                     // Player index with pagination
GET /api/players/[name]              // Individual player stats
GET /api/players/[name]/seasons      // Player season-by-season
GET /api/teams                       // Team index
GET /api/teams/[name]                // Team history
GET /api/teams/[name]/[season]       // Team season roster
GET /api/seasons/[year]              // League overview for year
GET /api/leaders/[category]          // Statistical leaders
GET /api/search                      // Universal search
```

### **Step 3: Frontend Components**
```vue
// New components needed:
PlayerProfile.vue        // Main player page
