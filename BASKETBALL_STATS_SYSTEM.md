### Statistically Estimated (based on models)
- **FG%** - Field Goal Percentage (estimated from PPG trends)
- **FT%** - Free Throw Percentage (correlated with scoring ability)
- **3P%** - Three Point Percentage (volume shooter estimation)
- **TS%** - True Shooting Percentage (approximated)

### Custom Calculated
- **Impact Score** - Replaces PER with realistic calculation
- **Game Impact** - Scoring volume √ó consistency √ó efficiency
- **Usage Rate** - Estimated team offensive usage
- **Versatility** - Multi-skill rating (0-5 scale)
- **Efficiency Index** - Points per estimated possession

## üéØ Why This Approach Is Better

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Python Backend
```python

    # Use actual data: points, games, average
    # Estimate missing stats with statistical models
    # Return honest, labeled metrics
```

### Vue.js Frontend
```vue
<!-- Custom Statistics Builder -->
<CustomStatsBuilder 
  :players-data="players"
  @save-stat="addCustomMetric"
/>

<!-- Export Modal with multiple formats -->
<ExportModal 
  :filtered-players="tableData"
  @export="downloadData"
/>
```

### Key Features
- **Formula Validation**: Safe evaluation of custom statistics
- **Batch Processing**: Handle 10,000+ players efficiently  
- **Memory Optimization**: Lazy loading and pagination
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failures with user feedback

## üìà Example Custom Statistics

### Game Impact Score
```javascript
(points / games) * math.sqrt(games) * 0.8
// Rewards high PPG and consistency
```

### Volume Efficiency  
```javascript
(points / games) * (1 + games / 30)
// PPG with bonus for durability
